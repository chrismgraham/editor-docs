Once you have :ref:`created an account on the editor <signup>`, you can create your own questions and exams, as well as look at and make copies of those made by others.

Let's create an exam using questions already in the database.

Once you have tried out the exam, close its window and return to the exam editor. Consider adding some text to the description field.
The description should be short -- one or two lines -- and will appear underneath the exam's name in the exam listing page.

Adding more questions to your exam

On the editing page for your exam, click the :guilabel:`Questions` link in the sidebar to go to the question selection area. 
On the left is space for your selected questions, and on the right are tabs offering different ways of finding questions to add.
