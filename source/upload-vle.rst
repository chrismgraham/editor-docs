Uploading an exam to a virtual learning environment
===================================================

Numbas produces SCORM objects which can be uploaded to any SCORM 2004-compatible VLE (virtual learning environment).

This page contains instructions on uploading a Numbas exam to Blackboard and Moodle. The first step is to create a SCORM package of your exam.

Creating a SCORM package
------------------------

Each question and exam has a download link in the sidebar which, when clicked, offers a selecton of options. If you just want to make an exam available on the web and don't need to track scores, click the :guilabel:`standalone .zip (no SCORM)` link. For a version which can be uploaded to a VLE such as Blackboard or Moodle, click the :guilabel:`SCORM package` link.

In both cases, a .zip file containing everything needed to run the exam will be downloaded to your computer. 

Uploading to Blackboard
-----------------------

.. note::

    At least Blackboard 9.1 Service Pack 6 is required to run Numbas exams. There's no way of checking your Blackboard version from within Blackboard, so check with your server admin that you're using a sufficiently recent version.

The default options are usually fine, but you should make sure that the settings under :guilabel:`SCORM availability` in particular are how you want them.

Take a look at the rest of the settings on the page to make sure they're set how you want. The default settings are usually fine, though you might like to set :guilabel:`Hide navigation buttons` to :guilabel:`Yes` to save screen space.

When you're ready, click on :guilabel:`Save and display`. Your exam is ready to use!
